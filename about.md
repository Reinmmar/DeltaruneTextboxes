# Deltarune Textboxes

## This mod turns every <cb>Popup</c> into a <cr>Deltarune</c> styled textbox!

You can <cj>advance</c> the text by pressing <cy>Z</c>, <cy>Enter</c> or by </cy>tapping</c>/</cy>clicking</c> on the screen!

You can <cj>skip</c> the text by pressing <cy>X</c> or <cy>tapping</c>/<cy>clicking</c> while the text rolls out!

If you want to suggest a feature, create an issue on github or ping me on discord (@timestepyt)
